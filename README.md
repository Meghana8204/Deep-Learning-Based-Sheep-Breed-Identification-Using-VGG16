# Deep-Learning-Based-Sheep-Breed-Identification-Using-VGG16
This project was developed as a major project during my final year (2024â€“25) using deep learning to identify various sheep breeds based on images. The model was built using **VGG16** with transfer learning and evaluated for accuracy, precision, and F1-score.
