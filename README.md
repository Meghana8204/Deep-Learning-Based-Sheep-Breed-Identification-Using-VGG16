#  Deep Learning-Based Sheep Breed Identification Using VGG16

This project was developed as a major project during my final year (2024â€“25) using deep learning to identify various sheep breeds based on images. The model was built using **VGG16** with transfer learning and evaluated for accuracy, precision, and F1-score.

##  Tools & Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Google Colab  
- VGG16 Pretrained Model  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- ImageDataGenerator

##  Working Process

1. Load and preprocess sheep breed dataset (6 classes).  
2. Use **VGG16** as base model with frozen layers.  
3. Add Dense, Dropout, and Batch Normalization layers.  
4. Train the model and evaluate on test data.  
5. Visualize results with graphs and confusion matrix.
